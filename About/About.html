                <p>Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. These shifts may be caused by significant volcanic eruptions or changes in the sun's activity. However, human activity has been the primary cause of climate change since the 1800s, mostly as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.</p>
                <p>Fossil fuel combustion releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which encircle the planet like a blanket and trap solar heat, causing temperatures to rise. Methane and carbon dioxide are the two primary greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. These gases result, for instance, from using coal to heat a building or gasoline to operate a vehicle. Carbon dioxide can also be released through land clearing and forest destruction.</p>

                <h2>Human Activity and Global Warming</h2>
                <p>Scientists studying climate change have demonstrated that, for the past 200 years, almost all global warming has been caused by people. Greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as the ones listed above are warming the planet more quickly than it has warmed in the previous two millennia.</p>

                <p>The average temperature of the Earth's surface is currently 1.2째C higher than it was during the last 100,000 years and higher than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution). The last four decades have all been warmer than any other decade since 1850, with the most recent decade being the warmest on record, from 2011 to 2020.</p>
                <p>Many believe that the primary effect of climate change is increased temperatures. However, the story doesn't end with a rise in temperature.</p>

                <p>Since everything on Earth is interconnected, changes in one place might have an impact on changes in all other areas since the Earth is a system. Today, severe droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms, and declining biodiversity are just a few of the effects of climate change.</p>
                <p>Thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed in a series of UN reports that keeping the rise in global temperature to more than 1.5째C would help us avoid the worst effects of climate change and maintain a livable climate. However, present practices indicate that temperatures will climb by 3째C by the end of the century.</p>

                <p>Climate change may have an impact on our jobs, housing, safety, food production, and general health. Some of us, like those who reside in small island nations and other developing nations, are already more susceptible to the effects of climate change.</p>

                <p>Prolonged droughts are increasing the risk of starvation, while conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have progressed to the point that entire populations have had to evacuate. It's anticipated that more people may be relocated in the future due to weather-related incidents.</p>
